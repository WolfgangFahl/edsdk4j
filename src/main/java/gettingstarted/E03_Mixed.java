/**
 * In most situations you'll want to mix/match the raw power of the EDSDK,
 * but use the the CanonCamera class to take care of all the heavy lifting
 * like threaded access and the other small issues that need to be taken care
 * of.
 * 
 * This example here doesn't do much, but if you ever need to accomplish
 * something that's not possible with the higher level api from
 * edsdk.utils.* directly then this is the place to start!
